Organization Production Function
This project analyzes the labor costs and services rendered (output) of an organization. 

Objective:
Determine the production function of labor in order to find optimal amount of staff budget necessary, given a an annual budget constraint. 

Methodology
1) Retrieve historical data from the organization relating to staff and program expenditures.
2) Transform the labor inputs into Log form.
3) Estimate the output elasticity of labor by using a linear regression.
4) Plug the elasticity into the log form Cobb Douglas Production function.
