Organization Production Function
This project analyzes the labor costs and services rendered (output) of an organization. 

Objective:
Determine the production function of labor in order to find optimal amount of staff budget necessary, given a an annual budget constraint. 

Methodology:
1) Retrieve historical data from the organization relating to staff and program expenditures.
2) Transform the labor inputs into Log form.
3) Estimate the output elasticity of labor by using a linear regression.
4) Use the elasticity for the log form Cobb Douglas Production function F(L).
5) Fit the data to the new model.

Findings:
The model predicts labor outputs with a standard deviation within +/-6%. Organizational leadership can use this insights for business operations, budgeting, finance, and strategy.
